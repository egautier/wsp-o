			<div class="info">
				<p>High-speed Internet, 4G wireless, the latest operating system for the industry’s most souped-up laptop… 
				and it’s all still a snail’s pace to <strong>The Flash.</strong>Young Barry Allen’s life stopped the minute his mother was murdered.
				The true killer never found, its mystery obsessed Barry, driving him to become a forensic scientist. Consumed by his
				work, he spent his life chained to his desk, solving every case that flew across it. But when a freak lightning bolt
			    hits a nearby shelf in his lab, Barry receives super-speed, becoming the Flash. Now, he’ll race up buildings, across
			    oceans, and around the world to get his man—while getting introduced to a world so much bigger than his old life of microscopes 
			    and cold cases.</p>

			    <p>Able to run at near light-speeds, his powers provide the ultimate caffeine kick: He can run up buildings, move so swiftly 
			    he phases through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers—and never need to order delivery. Despite his speed, 
			    Barry can become so obsessed with crime-solving he can still lose track of everything else around him, leaving the fastest man 
			    alive constantly running a minute behind.<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/characters/the-flash"><em>Dc Comics</em></a></p>

			<h2 id="team">The Scarlet Team</h2>

					<p>Nicknamed the <strong>Scarlet Speedster</strong>, all incarnations of the Flash possess "super-speed", which includes the ability to run 
					and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes and seemingly violate certain laws of physics. Thus far, four different 
					characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of "super-speed"—have assumed the identity of the Flash: <em>Jay Garrick</em> 
					<span>(1940–present)</span>, <em>Barry Allen</em> (1956–1985, 2008–present), <em>Wally West</em> <span>(1986–2006, 2007–present)</span>, and <em>Bart Allen</em> (2006–2007, 
					2009–present). Before Wally and Bart's ascension to the mantle of the Flash, they were both Flash protégés under the same 
					name Kid Flash.</p>

					<p>The second incarnation of the Flash, Barry Allen, is generally considered the first hero of the Silver Age of comic books 
					and the superhero has remained one of DC's most popular ever since. Each version of the Flash has been a key member of at least 
					one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans. Wally West has recently 
					rejoined the Justice League, and Barry Allen recently returned to life in the pages of Final Crisis.</p>

					<p>The Barry Allen version of the character (with Wally West elements) was featured in a live action television series in 1990, 
					starring John Wesley Shipp. The Wally West version of the Flash (but with many elements of Barry Allen's story) is featured in 
					the animated series Justice League.</p>

					<p>The Flashes have often been close friends with the various men who have been the Green Lantern; the most notable friendships 
					have been forged between Jay Garrick and Alan Scott (the Golden Age Green Lantern), Barry Allen and Hal Jordan (the Silver Age 
					Green Lantern) and Wally West and Kyle Rayner (the modern Green Lantern), as well as Jordan's friendship with West.</p>

			<h2 id="villains">The Villains</h2>

					<p> This are some of the villains that during the history have being against our heroes. Each one of them has a cool history behind
					it, so check them out.</p>

						<h4>Murmur</h4>
						<p>Dr. Michael Amar, a once respected surgeon, succumbed to madness and started a killing spree to stop the voices inside his head. 
						This spree went through Central and Keystone City and caught the eye of police officers Fred Chyre and Joe Jackam. They later tracked 
						Amar down with the help from Central City forensic scientist, Barry Allen. Part of Amar's psychosis is the inability to stop himself 
						from blurting out his crimes. Because of these outbursts, he is quickly convicted and sentenced to death.It is soon discovered that Amar's 
						blood is so abnormal that lethal injection can not kill him. While incarcerated in Iron Heights prison, Amar cuts out his own tongue and sews 
						his mouth shut so he will no longer be able to incriminate himself. Wearing a thin mask of his own design, Amar becomes known as Murmur.
						While in prison, Murmur creates a virus that kills the guards and prisoners and escapes during the riots it causes. He then joins Blacksmith, 
						who helps him with creating the virus, and her rogues. Afterwards, Murmur strikes out on his own.
						Murmur is one of the villains being controlled by the Top during the Rogue War story arc.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_(DC_Comics)">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<a id="mur" href="images/murmur.jpg" title="Murmur"><img src="images/murmur.jpg" alt="murmur" title="Murmur"/></a>

						<h4>Heat Wave</h4>
						<p>Born on a farm outside Central City, Mick Rory became fascinated with fire, as a child. This fascination turned into an obsession and one 
						night, he set his family's home ablaze. His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help.
						After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle. His pyromania continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and 
						setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip. He took a job as a fire eater with a traveling circus. This did not 
						last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire. He has an intense fear of cold, called cryophobia. This was due to a school field trip 
						(noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a walk in freezerIt was these events that made him desperate to fight 
						his fire obsession and after seeing the Rogues in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain. He created a protective costume 
						made of asbestos (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized flamethrower, and became Heat Wave. As he was committing 
						crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he'd run into the Flash, which he did quite regularly. Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly. 
						He also became an adversary of Captain Cold, due to his aversion to cold temperatures. It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues, and in his 
						first appearance they teamed up to get rid of the Flash as they competed over a newscaster they had both fallen in love with and fought each other as they each 
						tried to compete a larger crime spree, but the Flash jailed them both.Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the Top. He took a job 
						as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat. He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered 
						by Rory years before. Rory later succumbed to an offer by Abra Kadabra of gaining respect and infamy in the world. He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed 
						themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon Neron. Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.[2] The five 
						Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death, and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.[3]
						Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with Zhutanian monks.[4] Afterwards, he worked for Project Cadmus as a backup agent, but 
						eventually quit that too and moved to the Quad Cities, Illinois area. He eventually got a job at the FBI, along with other reformed members of the Rogues. This was a spectacular 
						failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed. In Infinite Crisis, Heat Wave became a member of the 
						Secret Society of Super Villains.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_Wave_(comics)">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<a id="heat" href="images/heat_wave.jpg" title="Heat Wave"><img src="images/heat_wave.jpg" alt="heat_wave" title="Heat Wave"/></a>

						<h4>The Top</h4>
						<p>Roscoe Dillon is a small-time crook who turns his childhood obsession with tops into a criminal persona. Roscoe taught himself how to spin around fast enough 
						to deflect bullets and produce other semi-useful effects. The Top soon discovers that the spinning somehow increased his intelligence as well, allowing him to 
						create a variety of trick tops. He tried to blackmail the world with an Atomic Top that would destroy half the world when it slowed down and imprisoned the Flash 
						inside it, but the Flash vibrated out of it and sent it into space. His unique gimmick and moderate success in crime soon makes him a respected member of the 
						Flash's rogues gallery. He dates Golden Glider, Captain Cold's sister, while coaching her on ice skating. Eventually, the Top develops immense psionic powers, 
						as years of spinning moves dormant brain cells to the outer areas of his brain, endowing him with mental powers. Unfortunately, the newly activated brain 
						cells are destroyed by close proximity to the Flash's superspeed vibrations. The Top dies within days from the injuries sustained by his brain, but not before 
						he plants a series of powerful bombs to destroy Central City as a final revenge. In addition, he prepared a recording explaining his terminal condition and 
						scheme to spitefully challenge his comrades to attempt to find and defuse the explosives which must be done by gathering them all and stacking them on top of 
						each other, knowing that The Flash would surely stop at least one of the attempts and doom the city. Knowing that neither the superhero nor the police would 
						believe them if they tried to warn either of the crisis, the Rogues desperately attempt to find the bombs despite the Flash's unwitting opposition. Fortunately, 
						the Flash eventually realizes the situation and aids in stopping the scheme in time. When Barry Allen's parents were in a car accident, Dillon's spirit is somehow 
						able to take possession of the vacant body of his father, Henry. Realizing who Barry Allen is, he, along with Golden Glider, plot to kill the Flash and take over 
						his body. He fails when he tries to take over the Flash's body while he is alive, leaving Henry's spirit to repossess his body.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_(comics)">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<h4>Abra Kadabra</h4>
						<p>Abra Kadabra is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made stage magic obsolete. However, he desires a career as a performing magician, so he goes 
						back in time to find an audience to entertain after stealing a time machine and inventing a device to paralyze the guards, and soon clashes with the Flash (Barry Allen). 
						He has a hypnotic device that makes people clap regardless of their thoughts, which he uses to force applause from audiences even when they don't applaud his magic tricks. 
						He finds his magic is being overlooked, so decides to involve himself in important events. When the Flash tries to stop a crime he is committing, he makes the Flash clap, 
						enabling him to escape. He is able to send the Flash into space after challenging him to a fight at the theatre, but the Flash is able to change the course of the planetoid 
						he is on so he is sent back to Earth, and finds Kadabra took his left-behind costume, meaning he can follow the impulses, and Kadabra is jailed. But he hypnotizes the Governor 
						using a ray from a device made out of pots and pans, to let him out, and starts staging a puppet show where the Flash is defeated by a puppet called Captain Cream-Puff. When 
						the Flash passes a poster advertising Kadabra, he is turned into a puppet and used in the performance. But the Scarlet Speedster is able to restore himself slightly using the 
						organic matter in his brain, which was not transformed, and then reverse Kadabra's ray so he is restored completely. He again defeats Kadabra.[volume & issue needed]In one of 
						his many confrontations with the Flash, Abra Kadabra's technology is damaged and his body becomes insubstantial and wraith-like.[volume & issue needed] After his body is returned 
						to normal, he is captured by a bounty hunter named Peregrine, and returned to his native century to serve a death sentence, although he is saved by the Flash before he can be executed.
						[volume & issue needed] Shortly after returning to the 21st century, during the Underworld Unleashed storyline, he forgoes his technological implements and tricks five rogues into 
						selling their souls to Neron so he can gain genuine magical powers.[1] Abra Kadabra later kidnapped Linda Park, the girlfriend of Wally West (Barry Allen's protégé and successor), 
						during their wedding and erases her from history, though he is ultimately defeated.[volume & issue needed] Abra Kadabra is mentioned in Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic mini-series. 
						In the fourth issue Timothy Hunter, escorted by Mister E, visits the 64th century, described by E as a time when the differences between magic and technology have become blurred. 
						The inhabitants tell them they have selected their "date-line" to send the "Madchild Abhararakadhararbarakh". Timothy Hunter responds "Abracadabra?" and Mister E tells him not to 
						talk to the inhabitants of this time, and so they then continue their path into the future. In Infinite Crisis, Abra Kadabra became a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains.
						 In "One Year Later", he and several other Rogues are approached by Inertia with a plan to kill the Flash (then Bart Allen). Though Inertia is defeated, Kadabra and the other Rogues 
						 successfully beat Bart to death, though not before Kadabra recognizes that Bart is too young to be the Flash they are used to dealing with.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abra_Kadabra_(comics)">
						 Wikipedia</a></p>

						<h4>Pied Piper</h4>
						<p>Hartley Rathaway (alias Thomas Peterson) was born deaf, but was eventually cured thanks to research funded by his wealthy father (later it was revealed that he was cured by Dr. Will Magnus).
						 He became obsessed with sound, and pursued little else in life; experimenting with sonic technology, Rathaway eventually invented a technique of hypnotism through music, and a way to cause 
						 deadly vibrations. Growing bored of his lifestyle, he turned to crime as the Pied Piper and frequently clashed with Barry Allen, the second Flash.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_(comics)">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<a id="piper" href="images/piedpiper.jpg" title="Pied Piper"><img src="images/piedpiper.jpg" alt="piedpiper" title="Pied Piper"/></a>

						<h4>Captain Cold</h4>
						<p>Captain Cold, real name Leonard Snart, is a comic book villain created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino as one of the archenemies of Flash.
						 He is a leader of the Rogues. A fan favorite, Captain Cold has served as a bitter enemy to the Silver-Age Flash Barry Allen, both enemy and grudging
						  friend to the modern-day Flash Wally West, and one of the killers of the fourth Flash Bart Allen.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Cold">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<a id="cold" href="images/captaincold.jpg" title="Captain Cold"><img src="images/captaincold.jpg" alt="captaincold" title="Captain Cold"/></a>


						<h4>Mirror Master</h4>

						<p>Mirror Master is a fictional character and a supervillain in the DC Universe. He is a recurring foe of the Flash with considerable technical expertise and skills involving 
						the use of mirrors. Four individuals have donned the guise of Mirror Master. In 2009, Mirror Master was ranked as IGN's 79th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.</p>

						<p>Sam Scudder was a simple convict, but had the goal to learn how to get inside the reflection of a mirror. Stumbling into a hall of mirrors, he experimented and discovered a way to 
						get in his own reflection. He used this power to become the criminal Mirror Master. He battled the Flash several times. Scudder died around the same time as Barry Allen, alongside 
						the Icicle during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Later, Captain Boomerang briefly assumed Scudder's identity, becoming the second Mirror Master. He used this as an alternate identity 
						with which to commit crimes, thus not alerting his teammates in Suicide Squad to his extracurricular activities. Pre-Crisis he studied mirrors after someone's reflection was held inside 
						a mirror he was working on in the prison workshop. He then learned how to create creatures of light. In Blackest Night crossover, Sam Scudder has reanimated as an undead Black Lantern 
						during the Blackest Night and is preparing an attack on The Rogues with the deceased members who are also reanimated. The Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror 
						with the words In Case of Flash: Break Glass. It has been shown in several past incidents that something lives in the mirror universe that is deadly. When the Flash enters the gateway of 
						unveil a giant mirror, it only shows him a vision of his mother. The Rogues learn that giant mirror is actually a slow acting poison.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Master">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<a id="master" href="images/mirrormaster.jpg" title="Mirror Master"><img src="images/mirrormaster.jpg" alt="mirrormaster" title="Mirror Master"/></a>

						<h4>The Rival</h4>
						<p>The Rival first appeared in Flash Comics #104 (February 1949). He is Dr. Edward Clariss, a professor at the university attended by the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick. He believes he has 
						recreated the formula that gives Garrick his speed, which he calls "Velocity 9." He heard Joan one night talking about how the Flash got his speed to another student, which helped him get 
						the last formula. Bitter at the rejection of his claims by the scientific community, though he had become famous for other inventions in Europe, Clariss becomes a criminal, wearing a darker 
						version of the Flash's outfit and giving it to several other criminals. He fakes his kidnapping to avoid suspicion. He then uses a machine to project his voice to the location. His men 
						capture the Flash and bring him to the hideout. He tries to make the Flash the slowest man alive with a different formula, but the Flash uses his original formula to get his speed back. 
						The Rival's version of the formula, however, proves to be temporary, and he is defeated with his crooks during an attempted bank robbery when it is expended and he is jailed. JSA #16 
						(November 2000) reveals that the Rival battled the Flash several months after his first appearance; in doing so he reaches lightspeed and vanishes into the Speed Force. Following the 
						reformation of the Justice Society of America 50 years later, Clariss is retrieved from the Speed Force (which had been revealed as the Valhalla of fallen speedsters, good or evil, as well 
						as their source of power) by Johnny Sorrow, who invites him to join the new Injustice Society. The Rival, driven to insanity by his time in the Speed Force, races across the country on a 
						super-speed killing spree. The Flash realizes that the Rival's path across the country spells out Clariss' name, and that the final murder will be Jay's wife Joan. The Flash is unable to 
						prevent the Rival killing a young boy, but manages to absorb the Rival's speed before he can kill Joan. The Rival returns in Impulse #88 (September 2002), posing as Joan Garrick's doctor. 
						Now pure speed energy, he possesses Garrick's fellow Golden Age speedster Max Mercury. After battling Jay and Impulse, the Rival escapes, still in possession of Max Mercury's body. He has 
						not been seen since. There is another Golden Age Reverse Flash, a robot who wears a reversed-color version of Garrick's costume. The robot's only appearance was in one panel in The Flash 
						vol. 2, #134 (February 1998), in which he is easily defeated by Garrick.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-Flash">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<h4>Gorilla Grodd</h4>
						<p>Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent telepathic gorilla with the power to control the minds of others. At one time, he was nothing more than an average ape, but after an alien spacecraft 
						(retconned from a radioactive meteor, the same one that empowered Hector Hammond) crashes in his African home, Grodd and his troupe are imbued with super-intelligence by the ship's pilot. 
						Grodd and fellow gorilla Solovar also develop telepathic and telekinetic powers. Taking the alien as their leader, the gorillas construct a super advanced home named Gorilla City. The gorillas 
						live in peace until their home is discovered by prying explorers. Grodd forces one of the explorers to kill the alien, and takes over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar 
						telepathically contacts Barry Allen to warn him of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd is defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and his allies.Originally 
						in his first Pre-Crisis appearance he first met the Flash while searching for Solovar, who had been imprisoned while on a trip to the human world. Grodd probed Solovar's mind to find the secret 
						of mind control, so he could control Gorilla City and use the inhbitants to take over the World, but Solovar breaks out of his cage and tells the Flash, so the Flash defeats him and apparently 
						knocks the power of mind control from his mind. But it is revealed he had not lost his power, he overcomes his guard and takes over an underground winged race by burrowing underground, trying 
						to use a machine to take away the intelligence of the other Gorillas. But Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped to and destroys the machine. The winged people are freed from his 
						control and Grodd is imprisoned again. Grodd has four guards set to guard him, but summons a burrowing machine which he uses to escape. He transforms himself into a human, and starts a factory 
						to create a pill that will give him vast mental powers. Grodd easily stops the Flash, but then unexpectedly turns into a Gorilla again, where his powers do not work as his brain is not evolved 
						enough. He tries to get to the machine that turned him into a human, but Flash molds the metal into handcuffs for Grodd, then takes him back to Gorilla City. Grodd devises a means of transporting 
						his mind to another body while his original one dies, and takes over a man in Central City, but is again arrested. Later he caused the first assembling of the Flash's Rogues Gallery, breaking 
						them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of 'Freddy', a Gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar the Flash found about Grodd's escape. Ironically Grodd, despite using 
						radiations to stop the Flash moving at superspeed, is defeated by the Gorilla's mate when she hears him mention another Gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Grodd">
						Wikipedia</a></p>

						<h4>Weather Wizard</h4>
						<p>Escaping a prison transport by leaping from the window, Mark Mardon fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to control 
						the weather before dying of a heart attack (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body[1]). Mardon took 
						Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate weather and embarked on a criminal career as The Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with 
						lightning) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by The Flash (Barry Allen). In his first appearance he tried to get revenge on the policemen who 
						imprisoned him, allowing the Flash to predict his target and defeat him. After Barry Allen's death during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, The Weather Wizard went into semi-retirement for a while, 
						until, during Underworld Unleashed, he teamed up with other Rogues which included Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Captain Boomerang, and Mirror Master, as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, 
						it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon Neron. They were later resurrected as soulless demons, by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor Wally West, who manipulated Neron 
						to return the Rogues' souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, save Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime. Weather Wizard joined up with Blacksmith and her rogues. Through her, he learns he 
						has a son from a one night stand with Keystone City police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same 
						ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, Linda and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability, but hesitated to harm the child when 
						he noticed that the child had "my eyes...my brother's eyes." He was stopped by Flash and sent to Iron Heights, but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with 
						Mirror Master and Trickster, joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the Secret Society of Super Villains.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Wizard">
