    		<h3>Client:<strong id="green">Florida Department Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles</strong></h3>
    		<h3>Project:<strong id="green">Web Re-design</strong></h3>

    		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
    	<div>
    		<p>The Composition of the page looks too tight for the view. Website needs more space for the eyes to breathe. Using
    		the Markup Validation Service W3C, it shows 31 errors and 7 warnings which by applying a new design will work on those.
    		Visual design is boring and confusing, too many things together in such a small view. Needs to be fixed.</p>
    		
    		<p>For better website's user interface/experience my redesign will consist in the following changes:<p>
    			<ol>
    				<li>Organize the entire website into 6 pages.</li>
    				<li>Build a header with logo, nav bar , footer for all pages.</li>
    				<li>Build homepage with small summary of the site along with special promotions the site offers.</li>
    				<li>Placing a fast entrance to most visited parts of the site in the home page.(ex. Driver's license check)</li>
    				<li>Make Florida residents and visitors feel more comfortable with the site also allowing them to do more through the site
    				in their homes.</li>
    				<li>Create a more percents of refers by applying more key words and also more time in the site having visitors looking at more
    				than one page.</li>
    			</ol>
    	</div>	
    		
    		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    	<div>
    		<p>Based on the traffic summary from Alexa.com The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has a global traffic
    		rank of <strong>15,656</strong> and <strong>2,281</strong> in the United States.</p>

    		<h2>Competition</h2>
    			<p id="small">As competition in the state of Florida for this type of service, the site has 2 competitors; the DMV.org which is a private
    			organization and dmvflorida.org whichs belongs to the goverment as well.</p>
    			
    			<p id="small">Research shows that the dmv.org private site works for the hole country with a rate ranking of <strong>1,519</strong> in the
    			US and the dmvflorida.org with the higher rate of all of them with <strong>15,341</strong> in the US which tells me the site
    			needs a better set of keywords and more popularity.</p>

    		<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
    		<p>As the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/flhsmv.gov#">Alexa.com</a> sites shows for the site it tells us that the site
    		has an audience that tends to be caucasican, "disproportionally childless women between the ages of 35 and 65 with no postgrade education and an income of over
    		$30,000.00." Something interesting is that shows a 1.7% visitors from India which tells me the site has a global traffic in terms
    		of migration or information in the state.</p>
